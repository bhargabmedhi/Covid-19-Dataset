# Covid-19-Dataset
With the world in disarray due to the COVID-19 epidemic, it became critical to have easily accessible and trustworthy data. This need gave rise to the COVID-19 Data Exploration and Dashboard project, which aims to offer a thorough research and visualization platform for comprehending the pandemic's impact. In order to extract insights and create a Tableau display, the project leveraged datasets from sources such as Our World in Data and applied SQL data exploration techniques. In order to enable informed decision-making and promote discussion on public health measures and socio-economic implications, the initiative provided stakeholders with an easy-to-use interface for examining critical indicators including verified cases, deaths, and immunizations.
